# If you want to use HTTPS.
You need a SSL cert.
The 2 ways i'm going to show are free.

[Letsencrypt Cert](letsencrypt.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary } [Cloudflare Cert](cloudflare.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## The downsides.
If you use letsencrypt. You need to renew the SSL record every 3 months. 
Cloudflare you dont. The one problem is you need to change your domain nameservers to cloudflare.

## The upsides.
Letsencrypt you can set up with 3 or more commands.
If you use CloudFlare you need to change your nameservers to cloudflare. But you get 5 year certificates. And after 5 years you can renew them.
